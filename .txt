# Homework Number X (variable)

Please don't solve any of the problems specified in the text. Each problem must be separated by two code cells 
and written in Spanish. Make sure all problems are exactly as they appear in the text, with a precise 
and clear translation. Do not add anything extra.

Use appropriate structure and formatting in the Markdown blocks for each problem, separated by 
well-organized code cells and use good latex if it is needed.

If any problem requires a link, include it after the problem statement as "Source: [link]".
